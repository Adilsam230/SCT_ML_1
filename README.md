# SCT_ML_1
A simple linear regression model built in Python to predict house prices based on key features. This project demonstrates a basic machine learning workflow using Scikit-learn and Pandas.

The script performs the following steps:
1. Loads housing data from a CSV file.
2. Selects features (SquareFootage, Bedrooms, Bathrooms) and a target (Price).
3. Splits the data into training and testing sets.
4. Trains a linear regression model.
5. Evaluates the model's performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
6. Uses the trained model to predict the price of a new, sample house.

This project requires Python and the following libraries:
1. Pandas
2. NumPy
3 .Scikit-learn
